# Open Pedigree Project - Corgi.Wiki
I'm building the **Open Pedigree Project** to make dog-health data openly accessible by everyone and especially for science. 
The first step is the my Corgi-ancestry analysis website [Corgi.Wiki](corgi.wiki). 
Until the code of the dog-ancestry database  is ready for public release, issues are collected here.

Furthermore all data (excluding images) collected will be released here in the near future as an archive of all corgis.
